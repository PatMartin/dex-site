## Welcome!

Welcome to the dex.js blog.  This blog will cover anything pertaining to the dex.js framework.  Older posts can be
found [on the old blog.](https://dexvis.wordpress.com).

I have switched the entire site over from the wordpress blog and doku wiki to a single integrated Hugo based site.
This gives me greater control of my content, better security and the ability to roll out updates faster than before.
