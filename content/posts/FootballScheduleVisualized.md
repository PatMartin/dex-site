# College Football Schedule

Playing around, I decided to the entire college football schedule into a dengrogram multiples visualization in Dex
and thought I would share the results.  We're visualizing the schedules for 124 different teams -- cool stuff.

Each multiple is fully interactive.  They can be shuffled around, resized and individual dendrograms are also
collapsible and expandable. No programming, and it took abound 2 minutes to build from start to finish.

## Results

## Project Breakdown

Within Dex, the project looks like this:

### Task Breakdown

  1. Read CSV - Read the dataset
  2. Select Columns - Select our 3 columns, Institution, opponent and location (away, home, neutral)
  3. Visualize with Dendrogram Multiples

# Side Notes

I am starting to become a big believer in the power of multiples as an effective visualization tool.  I hope that
folks find these new capabilities to be useful as well.

That's it for now...
