# Exploring the Word Tree

I must admit that sometimes when I am vetting out a visualization in Dex, I get lost and mesmerized by
the data.  Such was the case with the Word Tree; especially when loaded with extremely poignant datasets
such as the Ghettysburg Address and a timeline of World War I.  I'd like to share some of it here.

## Poetry

While I probably wouldn't admit it around the campfire with my buddies.  I have always
been moved by certain poetry.

### Edgar Alan Poe

In a world where we slaughter the language with social media attempting to coin new
nonsensical phrases such as "fleek and peeps", I find Edgar Alan Poe's ability to summon
dark imagery with words and sentence construction from a bygone era to be refreshing.

#### The Raven

#### Annabel Lee

## Historical Events

### The Ghettysburg Address

On November 19, 1863, at the dedication of a military cemetary at Ghettysburg, Pennsylvania,
during the Amarican Civil war.  Abraham Lincoln delivers one of the most memorable speeches
in American history -- consisting of only 7 sentences and 272 words.  It's amazing.

### World War I Timeline

I wanted to look at the extensive World War I timeline.  After 30 minutes of simply getting lost in
the events and fascinated exploration; I felt compelled to share it with everyone else.

### OJ Simpson Trial

Lastly, here is a word tree analysis of the timeline of the OJ Simpson trial.

I hope you like the Word Tree visualization as much as I do.
